	// To get the actual ID3D11Texture2D interface, you would have to call GetResourceView()->GetResource(&target), which returns
	// a ID3D11Resource, which could be cast to ID3D11Texture2D (?). The ID3D11Resource must also always be released manually after that.
	// So maybe it would be better to just provide a ID3D11Texture2D pointer here, so callers don't have to worry about that stuff.
